# Introduction to Skaffold Tutorial

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this Skaffold tutorial! This tutorial is about how to use Skaffold for continuous integration and deployment. We'll cover installing Minikube, kubectl, and Skaffold, to creating and deploying a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes. Additionally, we provide some scripts to help you!

### ðŸŽ¯ What you will do in this tutorial?

- Set up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube.
- Deploy a simple Spring Boot application to Kubernetes for testing.
- Use Skaffold to automate development workflows and streamline deployments.

### ðŸ’¡ Relevance/Motivation:

When you using Kubernetes in development. Typically, you would need to build images, push them to a registry, and apply configurations manually every time you make a change. This repetitive process makes the development cycle slow. Skaffold helps automate these tasks, enabling a seamless build and deploy cycle directly from your development environment. It greatly reduces the manual overhead and makes continuous development faster and more efficient, aligning well with DevOps best practices.
