# Introduction to Skaffold Tutorial

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this Skaffold tutorial! In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a local Kubernetes environment and use Skaffold for continuous integration and deployment. We'll cover everything from installing Minikube, kubectl, and Skaffold, to creating and deploying a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes. Additionally, we provide helpful scripts to streamline your setup process.

### ðŸŽ¯ What you will do in this tutorial?

- Set up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube.
- Deploy a simple Spring Boot application to Kubernetes for test.
- Use Skaffold to automate development workflows and streamline deployments.

### ðŸ’¡ Relevance/Motivation:

In the development process of Kubernetes applications, it's common to first develop, debug, and test locally, and then deploy to a Kubernetes cluster through CI/CD. This process can be cumbersome and inefficient, especially when verifying each code change requires redeploying the entire CI/CD pipeline. Even when setting up Kubernetes clusters locally, the process can still be tedious and slow.

Skaffold addresses this challenge by automating the deployment of Kubernetes applications. It is a command-line tool designed to facilitate continuous development for Kubernetes applications. By automating the build, push, and deployment stages, Skaffold allows developers to iterate quickly, making the entire process much more efficient and aligned with DevOps practices. With Skaffold, you can focus on coding while it takes care of the repetitive parts of deploying and testing applications, significantly speeding up development cycles.
